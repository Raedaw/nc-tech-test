### GET /cards/:cardId

I'm not sure if there is an error with the data provided as sizes.json and cards.json appear to be identical. I believe that because of this I was unable to access "available sizes" in order to deliver the information requested for GET /cards/:cardId on the readme.

As I have already demonstrated my ability to cross match two different files and use promise.all, I will use my remaining time to attempt the next end point, however I believe this section would have required accessing data from all three json files to provide the imageUrl and available sizes.
